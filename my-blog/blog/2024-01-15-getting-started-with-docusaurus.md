## Why Choose Docusaurus?

Docusaurus offers several advantages for developers looking to create a blog or documentation site:

- **React-based**: Built on React, allowing for rich interactive components
- **Markdown support**: Write content in Markdown with MDX support
- **SEO optimized**: Built-in SEO features and meta tags
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Extensive plugin system for customization
- **Versioning**: Built-in support for documentation versioning

## Setting Up Your Project

Getting started with Docusaurus is straightforward. Here's how to create a new project:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-blog classic --typescript
cd my-blog
npm start
```

This command creates a new Docusaurus project with:
- TypeScript support
- Classic template with blog functionality
- Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Customizing Your Blog

### 1. Updating Configuration

The main configuration file is `docusaurus.config.ts`. Here are some key settings to customize:

```typescript
const config: Config = {
  title: 'Your Blog Name',
  tagline: 'Your tagline here',
  url: 'https://your-domain.com',
  baseUrl: '/',
  
  // ... other configuration
};
```

### 2. Styling and Theming

Customize your blog's appearance by modifying `src/css/custom.css`:

```css
:root {
  --ifm-color-primary: #2563eb;
  --ifm-color-primary-dark: #1d4ed8;
  --ifm-color-primary-darker: #1e40af;
  --ifm-color-primary-darkest: #1e3a8a;
  --ifm-color-primary-light: #3b82f6;
  --ifm-color-primary-lighter: #60a5fa;
  --ifm-color-primary-lightest: #93c5fd;
}
```

### 3. Creating Blog Posts

Blog posts are written in Markdown and placed in the `blog/` directory. Each post should include frontmatter:

```markdown
---
slug: your-post-slug
title: Your Post Title
authors: [author-name]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

# Your Post Title

Your content goes here...
```

## Advanced Features

### MDX Support

Docusaurus supports MDX, allowing you to use React components in your Markdown:

```jsx
import {CodeBlock} from '@site/src/components/CodeBlock';

# My Post

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
console.log('Hello, Docusaurus!');
</CodeBlock>
```

### Custom Pages

Create custom pages by adding React components to `src/pages/`:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import Layout from '@theme/Layout';

export default function CustomPage(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <Layout title="Custom Page" description="A custom page">
      <div className="container">
        <h1>Custom Page</h1>
        <p>This is a custom page built with React!</p>
      </div>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

Docusaurus sites can be deployed to various platforms:

### GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Netlify

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `build`

### Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent naming**: Use kebab-case for file names and slugs
2. **SEO optimization**: Include proper meta descriptions and titles
3. **Image optimization**: Use appropriate image formats and sizes
4. **Mobile-first**: Ensure your design works well on mobile devices
5. **Performance**: Optimize your site for fast loading times
