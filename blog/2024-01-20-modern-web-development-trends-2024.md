- **New Use Cases**: Games, image processing, scientific computing
- **Framework Integration**: Better tooling and framework support

## 4. Micro-Frontends

Breaking down monolithic frontend applications:

- **Team Autonomy**: Independent development and deployment
- **Technology Diversity**: Different teams can use different frameworks
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale large applications

## 5. TypeScript Everywhere

TypeScript continues to dominate:

- **Better Developer Experience**: Improved tooling and error catching
